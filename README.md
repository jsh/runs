# runs
This code calculates the number of runs of increasing numbers in a list of floats. A "run" is a subsequence of a list where each element is greater than the previous element. For example, the list [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] has 3 runs: [1, 2, 3], [2, 1].

The kth Stirling number of the first kind is the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets.  

The number of permutations in a list of n floats that have exactly k runs is the kth Stirling number of the first kind, S(n, k).
